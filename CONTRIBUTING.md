## How to Contribute 

All contributions are welcome! This guide will get you up to speed with the contribution process for Gooey. 

Some Caveats Up Front: 

* Opening a PR does not guarantee it will be merged 
* Feedback may take time
* Merges may take time 


### Getting Started: 

All bugs and non-trivial changes must have an associated [issue](https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey/issues/new). So, step one should be making sure that your [issue doesn't already exist](https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue). If you find a relevant issue, feel free to add a comment with any additional details or problems specific to your use case. Otherwise, open a new issue and fill out the template in its entirety. 

An exception to this rule is for any "trivial" change such as language additions, documentation fixes, typo corrections, etc.. no issue is required for these. Just include a good description / overview in your PR. 

  
### Development Overview

All development and pull requests should be made directly against the master branch 


**Making Changes:**

* Group your commits into coarse example-level chunks (preferably one) and give a descriptive commit message (e.g. `"Added demo of featre XXX"`)
  * if making a bug fix, reference the issue number in your commit (e.g. "Closes #1234 - foo was not barring") 
	* Make your commits about One Thing. 
	* Avoid stream of consciousness style commits as they'll just be asked to be cleaned up during code review
* Make sure you've added tests for your feature / bug fix
* Backwards compatibility must be honored 


## Pull Request Process

Pull Requests should be made against `master`.

A good PR should hit these essentials.

Basic Checklist: 
 - [ ] Commit message includes the relevant issue number
 - [ ] Pull request description contains link to relevant issue
 - [ ] README.md is updated (if relevant)
 - [ ] PR has summary of the change and links to the detailed issue.  


## Code of Conduct

None. Use your best judgement. 

## Grumpy Stuff:

* Please do not email me directly to ask why your PR hasn't been merged 
* Please do not email me directly to ask why your issue hasn't been addressed. 

The answer will always be some stock variant of (1) I'm just _a_ guy, (2) I work on this for free (3) It's not a priority at the moment, (4) yes, I feel guilty all the time, (5) some weekends I just want to play a video game or something.
